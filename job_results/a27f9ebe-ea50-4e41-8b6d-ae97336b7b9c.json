You got that.  Yeah.\n[00:10] SPEAKER_02: I think so.\n[00:12] SPEAKER_02: It's been sent to you so you probably just need to maybe accept it.\n[00:16] SPEAKER_02: than what it was sent.\n[00:18] SPEAKER_02: um\n[00:19] SPEAKER_02: maybe Monday if not the back end of last week.\n[00:26] SPEAKER_02: from them? No, from me.\n[00:30] SPEAKER_03: It's made me shy, I love a lot.\n[00:32] SPEAKER_02: Always send it if not.\n[00:35] SPEAKER_02: and we can rearrange it.\n[00:35] SPEAKER_03: Certainly the report, thank you, got that, she's a paper.\n[00:41] SPEAKER_02: I'll be sent in.\n[00:43] SPEAKER_02: I think it's around 10.30 tomorrow.  We need to change it and change it.\n[00:49] SPEAKER_01: Okay.\n[00:55] SPEAKER_03: and he's nicked off\n[00:58] SPEAKER_02: that.\n[01:05] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.  Thank you.\n[01:06] SPEAKER_02: and the guy from the council.\n[01:09] SPEAKER_03: And at that point, should we have selected what we're doing?\n[01:12] SPEAKER_02: you\n[01:13] SPEAKER_02: He's going to discuss through the process, so we know roughly what we're going to do.  We're going to look at the compressor, and the lighting.\n[01:20] SPEAKER_02: and the window\n[01:23] SPEAKER_02: .  .  .  .  .\n[01:23] SPEAKER_01: Okay.\n[01:23] SPEAKER_03: Okay.\n[01:27] SPEAKER_03: that will take a final look at the bees project afterwards because I couldn't see windows on there  I couldn't see is that all in the thermal insulation?\n[01:41] SPEAKER_03: No, it's fine. I just don't know if Nick had agreed which ones he wants.\n[01:47] SPEAKER_02: Not in particular. We don't know how much funding we are allowed to apply for. That's part of the meeting we are going to have tomorrow.\n[01:54] SPEAKER_02: If there's a cap on the funding then we make a decision as to what's a priority.  If there's not then we might as well try and get as much as possible out of it.\n[02:04] SPEAKER_02: The compressor upgrade, you've got the A4 slide proposal.\n[02:09] SPEAKER_02: Yes, and I'll see that.\n[02:11] SPEAKER_02: That's gonna tie into the ultimate scenario.\n[02:15] SPEAKER_00: be short anymore about putting him on that mess.\n[02:17] SPEAKER_02: We need to get it tested with the flat weight.  I'm not sure it'll take the weight of all those compressors  and I don't know how it would benefit, if I'm honest.  Yeah.\n[02:19] SPEAKER_00: tested.\n[02:26] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's what I was just going to ask.\n[02:28] SPEAKER_00: What's the...  Well, we seem to think it will throw the heat out better if we're going to use them for  the heat in the winter.\n[02:38] SPEAKER_03: Oh, because it's...\n[02:41] SPEAKER_02: but the part where it can be direct since they're anywhere  into the studios from the back.\n[02:46] SPEAKER_02: I just don't think the floor will be stable enough for all that kit.\n[02:48] SPEAKER_00: all that care.\n[02:51] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.\n[02:52] SPEAKER_02: So no, we've not agreed on.\n[02:55] SPEAKER_02: and the location and then the back of the...\n[02:57] SPEAKER_03: I think my only thing with compressors should have a five, ten year life of whatever we're  doing now with them and we're saying over the next five to ten years we won't want to  overuse the office space again I don't think.\n[03:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.\n[03:12] SPEAKER_03: Do you know what I mean? We were completely taken away at that point.  Because you wouldn't be able to have anything else up there then, would you?\n[03:12] SPEAKER_02: You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.\n[03:19] SPEAKER_03: Are you talking about...\n[03:19] SPEAKER_02: most ones? Where we've moved the canteen down our program.\n[03:21] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, move the canteen down.  Move the canteen down.\n[03:29] SPEAKER_03: and then all you get on the plane and stuff like that.\n[03:32] SPEAKER_03: That's what, yeah.\n[03:36] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so only can I just say you haven't got to any space for a fortnight there.\n[03:40] SPEAKER_03: No, you don't.\n[03:40] SPEAKER_01: which is why we didn't put anything up there before.\n[03:43] SPEAKER_01: Okay.\n[03:43] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you know, like...\n[03:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you turn it and then you, that's why they see it matters, but there's no turning space.\n[03:49] SPEAKER_03: That's a good point actually because it did look like I've been excited reinforced you know and using it as a story.\n[03:53] SPEAKER_01: George\n[03:54] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.\n[03:57] SPEAKER_02: blah blah blah\n[03:59] SPEAKER_02: Any issues on either CMSs?\n[04:04] SPEAKER_02: Great. Any update from Blotty's?\n[04:08] SPEAKER_00: you\n[04:09] SPEAKER_00: Nope, not there now.\n[04:11] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.\n[04:12] SPEAKER_02: Is there any feedback from them going out to see the marauders?\n[04:14] SPEAKER_03: The only feedback I know about is...\n[04:19] SPEAKER_03: Long and short of the conversation ended up being that velocity we're going to go away and re-look at the proposal.  Yeah, that's what I was looking for.\n[04:33] SPEAKER_02: from a costume point of view.\n[04:35] SPEAKER_02: machine.\n[04:39] SPEAKER_03: And then I feel like...\n[04:43] SPEAKER_03: One of them, the sales director, is going to be here in a couple of weeks.\n[04:48] SPEAKER_03: Okay.\n[04:52] SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure on the date though, I'd love to confirm.\n[04:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.\n[04:59] SPEAKER_00: I jumped inside of the bar.\n[05:01] SPEAKER_00: you\n[05:02] SPEAKER_01: as a diagnosis.\n[05:02] SPEAKER_00: that.\n[05:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then basically said we go.\n[05:07] SPEAKER_03: So they've used lots of words like it's probably this, it could be that, it might be that, it could be possibly.  So the gist of the conversation on the stand was more along the lines of,  we've asked, you've said it could be a porous material, we don't use porous materials.  Show them.\n[05:26] SPEAKER_00: .  .  .  .  .\n[05:27] SPEAKER_03: model board, that's not porous by any shot of the imagination, obviously aluminium isn't.\n[05:33] SPEAKER_03: Um.\n[05:34] SPEAKER_03: We don't think they banked on us probably having test results of our SIDS for the last six months.\n[05:39] SPEAKER_03: to show that oil and water mix isn't a problem.  So therefore that's not what it is.\n[05:44] SPEAKER_00: causing it. And they say the seals went, but the seals shouldn't go. And that's originally when that happened.\n[05:52] SPEAKER_00: was red hot. The first time it went from the seals just periscent and they didn't put new  seals back in which...\n[05:58] SPEAKER_03: of you.\n[06:00] SPEAKER_03: So I think Craig went armed with...\n[06:03] SPEAKER_03: He's engineering head on and started talking about.\n[06:07] SPEAKER_03: Um.\n[06:08] SPEAKER_03: DMFEAs and when's the failure point of this seal and what's the temperature of this and  at that point Mr. Balotty came over and said we'll go away and have a look at the proposal.\n[06:20] SPEAKER_03: But you're never going to get them to. Apparently they've sent that material off for analysis.  Whether we'll actually ever find out.\n[06:28] SPEAKER_03: what it is.\n[06:29] SPEAKER_00: Did they do that before we went over or after?\n[06:32] SPEAKER_03: I'll let you.\n[06:35] SPEAKER_03: But I think whilst trying to keep things amicable at this point in time, that was.\n[06:42] SPEAKER_03: probably the best we could have got out of the conversation.  And that may well be what the guy's coming over  in a couple of weeks.  I'm assuming the second shape will be.\n[06:44] SPEAKER_02: And that's all I have to say.  Thank you.\n[06:46] SPEAKER_02: I'm assuming the second sheet covered your wrist from whatever's gone wrong on the first one.\n[06:51] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so we went over to visit.\n[06:55] SPEAKER_03: DNS, Mills Machining on Tuesday, which we're a large provider of.\n[07:02] SPEAKER_03: machines based in back in the Warwick.\n[07:05] SPEAKER_03: They recommended.\n[07:08] SPEAKER_03: company called Technova.\n[07:15] SPEAKER_03: and they rebuild hats and stuff,  but they're literally on a bit of an initial stay.\n[07:20] SPEAKER_03: Um.\n[07:21] SPEAKER_03: So they're going to come in.\n[07:25] SPEAKER_03: you\n[07:26] SPEAKER_03: I think.\n[07:28] SPEAKER_03: current velocity has.\n[07:31] SPEAKER_03: not because there's anything wrong with it at this point in time.\n[07:34] SPEAKER_03: yeah, will it be something that they'd be able to...\n[07:37] SPEAKER_00: Fingers went bloody, so the other one had.  It's going to come back and we're still none the wiser.  White failed.\n[07:45] SPEAKER_02: That's what I think.\n[07:45] SPEAKER_00: that.\n[07:45] SPEAKER_03: I think that's the point of having a look at the other piece.\n[07:54] SPEAKER_02: So they booked him in 10 overall?  No.\n[07:56] SPEAKER_00: No, we're going to get in touch with Mick next week.\n[08:04] SPEAKER_02: Her coz and the two.\n[08:06] SPEAKER_02: Probably have to see something 830. Is there any issues with those?  Yeah.  Which one?  830.  Yeah.\n[08:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  Which one?  The A30.  Yeah.  The edge not rotating properly.\n[08:15] SPEAKER_00: It sure too.\n[08:19] SPEAKER_00: get some more as to enough degrees at every time we can move the air.\n[08:25] SPEAKER_02: Has John spoken to anyone or reached out to anyone?\n[08:27] SPEAKER_00: That's it from Chris May\n[08:39] SPEAKER_03: I mean if they're really the person that could look at it, there's no reason we shouldn't.\n[08:43] SPEAKER_03: I think with the machines is whenever if we're busy and something goes down we want people that respond quickly.  And it was Chris who did that does respond quickly or not.  Yeah, they're pretty good.\n[08:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.\n[08:56] SPEAKER_00: you\n[08:57] SPEAKER_02: Probably worth getting Chris in first because if we've not got a date for technover yet,  you'd want it to be another.\n[09:02] SPEAKER_02: another week though, if it's not.\n[09:04] SPEAKER_00: How busy is it? Sorry? How busy is that machine? Not many.\n[09:05] SPEAKER_03: How busy is it?\n[09:05] SPEAKER_02: We\n[09:15] SPEAKER_00: So you can use it vertical, so it's a usable machine because it's a big machine.\n[09:20] SPEAKER_01: Hmm.\n[09:27] SPEAKER_00: I want you to at our fault.\n[09:29] SPEAKER_01: Hmm.\n[09:32] SPEAKER_03: We can always gather the information at this point in time and get somebody to look at it and quote us for whatever work needs to be done.\n[09:38] SPEAKER_02: At least know where we stand then when we do want to get it fixed.\n[09:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean the more I come in and say well I can do it now it's three hours.  See we've had the same problem on a machine where I've worked before.  But they come in, I can't remember whether it was Chris or my mate.\n[09:44] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it might be nothing.\n[09:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.\n[09:55] SPEAKER_00: but they come in and it was just a bit tweaked through the parameters and all that.\n[09:59] SPEAKER_03: I think it's worth getting.\n[10:04] SPEAKER_03: I appreciate it.\n[10:04] SPEAKER_00: Bye!\n[10:10] SPEAKER_02: OK, we'll leave that with you to get him in then Terry.  Yeah, I'll phone him in when I'm gone.\n[10:12] SPEAKER_00: Bye.\n[10:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm delighted.\n[10:14] SPEAKER_02: So the choreo Diana then.\n[10:19] SPEAKER_02: The pro forma for those repairs have been approved.  Navi's making payment on the 15th.  I've got Dan Ngo at Rotatec.  So as soon as they've received it,  they'll schedule that work.\n[10:31] SPEAKER_02: The work on the Bridgeport can then be done on a PO basis once.\n[10:36] SPEAKER_02: and had this pro forma paid.  So we can raise the PO and get that.\n[10:40] SPEAKER_02: And that's on 30 days from end of month, that one,  the agreed terms on that one.\n[10:47] SPEAKER_02: And...\n[10:48] SPEAKER_02: Any issues on the XYZ?\n[10:49] SPEAKER_00: No.\n",
