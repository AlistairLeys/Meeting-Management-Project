I'm Alistair.\n[00:08] SPEAKER_00: OK.\n[00:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so what are we going to try and get done today, Cap?\n[00:14] SPEAKER_01: Well, we're going to test this out, this taking out, see if it is working with the  desktop on our...  See if the, this audio device that we did originally intend to, like track speakers  and stuff in the room, but now...\n[00:31] SPEAKER_01: I don't know, it depends on where we're going with this project but it is just a great audio  device to have because the audio files that they have sent over to us haven't really been  the best.  Their laptop, cameras, the consistency to just have a system high quality microphone  device is going to be so useful in and of itself.  It is.  I'm interested to see how it takes on background noise too.\n[00:40] SPEAKER_00: the laptop\n[00:49] SPEAKER_00: you\n[00:49] SPEAKER_00: What?\n[00:53] SPEAKER_00: So what are we gonna... so obviously we're gonna catch up next week so what do we  want to have done by then? Is there anything in particular? What are our goals?\n[01:03] SPEAKER_01: So my goal... I'm doing something completely separate.  I want to have a singing business plan, I simply...\n[01:12] SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's not quite...\n[01:14] SPEAKER_00: Fair enough, but I was talking about it specifically today.\n[01:16] SPEAKER_01: I know, I just give my actual big surprise to you.\n[01:19] SPEAKER_00: But, you know.\n[01:20] SPEAKER_01: You know.\n[01:22] SPEAKER_01: It's still an action point, that would be a sign to car.  That's my action.\n[01:24] SPEAKER_00: That's my action.  So we want to make sure that we've got,  but actually what we actually do need to do,  we need to have the...\n[01:33] SPEAKER_00: We need to have the front end properly converted to code.  We need to have created, I want us to work on this today actually, get the contract,  phase three, sent over to them so we need to mock that up.\n[01:47] SPEAKER_00: Excuse me.\n[01:49] SPEAKER_00: And then I always, I'd quite like to have a little, a little experiment with notes.\n[01:53] SPEAKER_01: You know today, should we see if, you can ask them if they accept the prototype or how  and then we can conclude phase one, we want to send you over testing, you should know  April phase two.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.\n[02:06] SPEAKER_00: you\n[02:07] SPEAKER_01: We can say you can accept it as is or if you're not entirely comfortable with it right now, you know  Want some more trust there then we can say, you know phase one doesn't conclude officially until we've sent you over something to test  We can say that today\n[02:21] SPEAKER_00: ...\n[02:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I think that I've already told him phase one's finished.\n[02:23] SPEAKER_01: I mean.\n[02:24] SPEAKER_01: To be honest, I think they'll...\n[02:29] SPEAKER_00: that they need to accept that.  Yeah they do.  But they can't do that until we've given them something to play with.\n[02:35] SPEAKER_00: So...\n[02:36] SPEAKER_01: that we were going to do that.\n[02:39] SPEAKER_00: No, but it's not in there as a deliverable, but it's in there as...\n[02:44] SPEAKER_00: thing they will get five days to test.\n[02:47] SPEAKER_00: So, and then they get to come back to us with two corrections.\n[02:51] SPEAKER_00: which I haven't done.\n[02:53] SPEAKER_01: well\n[02:55] SPEAKER_01: Can't we just say we've already done that?  The end is...\n[02:59] SPEAKER_01: How can they give you back some change things things are changing them?  Like testing doesn't mean going away and playing with something testing can also mean  uh talking about it and and playing around with  Stakeholders that's a form of testing as well, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah\n[03:17] SPEAKER_01: But all that really matters, we've got things ripped down and stuff and if they want to  hold us to that that's fine. All that really matters is that they are the primeval set.\n[03:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think maybe we don't even get so formal with it.  We can just kind of say like, let's get the phase two stuff.\n[03:34] SPEAKER_00: We'll send that contract over.  No point in us completing it anyway until they've got ready for phase two.\n[03:41] SPEAKER_00: They can be playing with it while we're...  Anyway, that's the conclusion of the meeting.  We're all happy, all done, yeah?\n",
